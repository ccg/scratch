TetherBot here:

http://graha.ms/androidproxy/

Android app package:
http://graha.ms/androidproxy/Tetherbot.apk
(Need to click from phone's browser to install. Also need to enable
installation from untrusted sources.)

(Might be able to do 'adb install Tetherbot.apk' but I haven't tried that.)

Don't forget to turn on USB Debugging on phone!

Solution: G1 --> Home --> Menu --> Settings --> Applications --> Development
--> USB debugging

Problem: ./adb says file not found even when it's clearly right there.

Cause: adb is a 32-bit binary, but I'm running a 64-bit Ubuntu.

Solution: sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

----

Problem: ./adb shows no devices even with G1 attached.

Solution:

(Plug in G1 if haven't already.)

lsusb to find device id
(mine says "Bus 007 Device 005: ID 0bb4:0c01 High Tech Computer Corp.")

Fix udev:
Create /etc/udev/rules.d/50-android.rules with the following line:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb",SYSFS(idVendor)=="0bb4",MODE="0666"

Instructions came from here:
http://bradchow.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/adb-on-windows-and-ubuntu-linux/
...but they're incorrect about chmod. udev files don't need x bit set.

Restart udev for changes to take effect:
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart

----

SSH'ing to remote server:

Start tetherbot on phone
Set IP and port (if necessary) (lrz2: 75.127.96.6)
$ adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:Tunnel
$ ssh -p 4444 cglendenin@localhost

----

Connecting to the web via proxy:

Start tetherbot's socks proxy
$ adb forward tcp:1080 tcp:1080
set firefox proxy: socks hosts: localhost port: 1080
